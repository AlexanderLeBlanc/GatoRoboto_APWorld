## Where is the options page?

Visit the [options page for this game](../player-options) to generate a YAML file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Currently, the randomizer supports item and event randomization. There are also options to include skips and/or sequence 
breaks, such as **Rocket Jumping**, to vary the logic.

The default goal is to **Defeat Gary**, which is identical to the vanilla experience. Other future goal implementations
will include **All Cartridges** and **100%**, to provide alternative and longer, more progressive experiences.

## What items and locations get randomized?

All of the following are randomized by default:
- Healthkits
- Cartridges
- Upgrade Modules
- Progressive Events
- Rebba's Shop

A future update will enable options to disable shuffling of these individual item groups.

Visit the [options page](../player-options) for a comprehensive list of items and locations and what changes you can make to the game.

## What other changes are made to the game?

A few quality of life improvements have been made to the base game:
- A single save slot exists to contain the AP save, to avoid save file issues.
- Starting a new game now places Kiki directly in the mech room, allowing the player immediate access to the mech suit.
- Tutorial dialogs (intro, swimming, mech, etc.) have been removed.
- 'Warp to Nexus' is now a pause menu option, allowing players to warp to the Big PC once they have visited the Nexus.
