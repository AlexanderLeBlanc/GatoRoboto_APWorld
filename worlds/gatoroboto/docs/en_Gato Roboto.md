## Where is the options page?

Visit the [options page for this game](../player-options) to generate a YAML file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Currently, the randomizer supports item and event randomization. There are also options to include skips and/or sequence breaks, such as **Rocket Jumping**, to vary the logic.

The default goal is set to **Defeat Gary**, which is identical to the vanilla experience. Other goals include **All Cartridges** and **100%**, to provide alternative and longer, more progressive experiences.

## What items and locations get randomized?

By default, all of the following are randomized:
- Healthkits
- Cartridges
- Upgrade Modules
- Progressive Events
- Rebba's Shop

Visit the [options page](../player-options) for a comprehensive list of items and locations and what changes you can make to the game.

## What other changes are made to the game?

A few QoL improvements have been made to the base game:
- Starting a new game now places Kiki in the mech room, allowing the player immediate access to the mech suit.
- Tutorial dialogs (intro, swimming, mech, etc.) have been removed.
- All collectible item sprites have been replaced with the AP icon.
